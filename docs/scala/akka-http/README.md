# Akka-Http

## Generating a Server

guardrail-generated servers come in two parts: a `Resource` and a `Handler`. The `Resource` contains all the routing logic, accepting a `Handler` as an argument to the `route` function in order to provide an HTTP service in whichever supported HTTP framework you're hosting your service in.

The following is an example from the [akka-http](https://github.com/akka/akka-http) server generator:

```scala mdoc:passthrough
import dev.guardrail.docs._
DocsHelpers.renderScalaSnippet("akka-http", GeneratingAServer)("""
    |// The `Handler` trait is fully abstracted from the underlying http framework. As a result, with the exception of some
    |// structural alterations (`F[_]` instead of `Future[_]` as the return type) the same handlers can be used with
    |// different `Resource` implementations from different framework generators. This permits greater compatibility between
    |// different frameworks without changing your business logic.
  """.stripMargin,
  ""
)
```

As all parameters are provided as arguments to the function stubs in the trait, there's no concern of forgetting to extract a query string parameter, introducing a typo in a form parameter name, or forgetting to close the bytestream for the streaming HTTP Request.

### Extracting custom data from a request

In some cases, you may wish to extract data from a request and inject it into your handler, without specifying the extracted data in the OpenAPI definition. Common use cases include integrating with existing `Directive`s, accessing underlying data provided by akka-http but without a direct analog in OpenAPI, as well as providing an escape hatch to inject functionality expressed via akka-http's `Directive` directly into the Akka HTTP routes generated by guardrail.

If using the guardrail CLI, supply `--custom-extraction` when generating your server in order to get this functionality.

Once the feature is enabled, the generated code from the above example is modified to look like this:

```scala
trait UserHandler[-E] {
  def createUser(respond: UserResource.CreateUserResponse.type)(body: definitions.User)(extracted: E): scala.concurrent.Future[UserResource.CreateUserResponse]
  // ...
}

object UserResource {
  def routes[E](handler: UserHandler, customExtract: String => Directive1[E])(implicit mat: akka.stream.Materializer): Route = {
    // ...
  }
}
```

You may now provide a function that accepts the `operationId` of the route, and returns a `Directive1[E]`, where, `E` is an arbitrary type that will be passed through to your handlers. The `Directive1[E]` will be injected into the generated routes _after_ the path and method `Directive`s.

_Note:_ If you have any `Directive` with an arity different to `Directive1` (for instance, `Directive0` or `Directive5`) you must convert it into a `Directive1` via `myCoolDirective.tmap(Tuple1(_))` or similar. This is done to provide a consistent user experience, without the added complexity of the so-called "magnet pattern".

For example, to extract an `X-User-Id` header value from an incoming request, your code might look like this:

```scala
class UserApi extends UserHandler[String] {
  override def createUser(respond: UserResource.CreateUserResponse.type)(body: definitions.User)(userIdHeader: String): scala.concurrent.Future[UserResource.CreateUserResponse] = {
    println(s"The supplied X-User-Id header is: $userIdHeader")
    ???
  }
}

val extractXUserId = (operationId: String) => headerValueByName("X-User-Id") // Directive from Akka HTTP

val userRoutes = UserResource.routes(new UserApi, extractXUserId)

```

Because `E` is an arbitrary type, you may extract anything, including the full `HttpRequest` itself. Multiple values may be extracted using tuples. If you do not wish to extract anything, perhaps because the `Directive` acts as a gate which `pass`es some requests and `reject`s others, simply provide `String => Directive1[Unit]` and write your handler implementation to extend `Handler[Unit]`.

## Generating test-only (real) server mocks for unit tests

Often, we'll also want to have mock HTTP clients for use in unit tests. Mocking requires stringent adherence to the specification, otherwise our mock clients are unrepresentative of the production systems they are intending to mock. The following is an example of a "mock" HTTP Client generated by guardrail; it speaks real HTTP, though doesn't need to bind to a port in order to run. This permits parallelized tests to be run without concern of port contention.

```scala
val userRoutes: Route = UserResource.routes(new UserHandler {
  override def getUserByName(respond: UserResource.getUserByNameResponse.type)(username: String): scala.concurrent.Future[UserResource.getUserByNameResponse] = {
    if (username == "foo") {
      Future.successful(respond.OK(User(id=Some(1234L), username=Some("foo"))))
    } else {
      Future.successful(respond.NotFound)
    }
  }
})
val userHttpClient: HttpRequest => Future[HttpResponse] = Route.toFunction(userRoutes)
val userClient: UserClient = UserClient.httpCLient(userHttpClient)
val getUserResponse: EitherT[Future, Either[Throwable, HttpResponse], User] = userClient.getUserByName("foo").map(_.fold(user => user))
val user: User = getUserResponse.value.futureValue.right.value // Unwraps `User(id=Some(1234L), username=Some("foo"))` using scalatest's `ScalaFutures` and `EitherValues` unwrappers.
```

This strategy of mocking ensures we follow the spec, even when the specification changes. This means not only more robust tests, but also tests that communicate failures via compiler errors instead of at runtime. Having a clear separation of where errors can come from permits trusting our tests more. If the tests compile, any and all errors that occur are in the domain of business logic.

One other strategy for testing non-guardrail generated clients is to bind `userRoutes` from above to a port, run tests that use hand-rolled or vendor-supplied HTTP clients, then unbind the port when the test ends:

```scala
val binding: ServerBinding =
  Http().bindAndHandle(userRoutes, "localhost", 1234).futureValue

// run tests

binding.unbind().futureValue
```

### A note about scalatest integration

The default `ExceptionHandler` in akka-http swallows exceptions, so if you intend to `fail()` tests from inside guardrail-generated HTTP Servers, you'll likely want to have the following implicit in scope:

```scala
implicit def exceptionHandler: ExceptionHandler = new ExceptionHandler {
  def withFallback(that: ExceptionHandler): ExceptionHandler = this
  def seal(settings: RoutingSettings): ExceptionHandler = this

  def isDefinedAt(error: Throwable) = error.isInstanceOf[org.scalatest.TestFailedException]
  def apply(error: Throwable) = throw error
}
```

This passes all `TestFailedExceptions` through to the underlying infrastructure. In our tests, when we call:

```scala
val userClient: UserClient = UserClient.httpCLient(userHttpClient)
val getUserResponse: EitherT[Future, Either[Throwable, HttpResponse], User] = userClient.getUserByName("foo")
val user: User = getUserResponse.map(_.fold(user => user)).value.futureValue.right.value
```

`futureValue` will raise the `TestFailedException` with the relevant stack trace.

## Generating clients

As we've seen in [Generating a Server](scala/akka-http/README.md#generating-a-server), guardrail-generated servers establish a mapping between our business logic and a cordoned off subset of HTTP. This permits us to focus on our business logic, without getting overloaded with the complexities of managing such a large protocol. The same is true with guardrail generated HTTP Clients: from a consumer's standpoint, HTTP calls should look like regular function calls, accepting domain-specific arguments and producing domain-specific results.

By generating minimal clients that only have enough business knowledge to map domain types to and from HTTP, opportunities for logical errors are effectively removed. While this does not eliminate logical errors entirely, establishing a firm boundary between the underlying protocol and hand-written code drastically reduces the scope of possible bugs.

The following is an example from the [akka-http](https://github.com/akka/akka-http) client generator:

```scala mdoc:passthrough
import dev.guardrail.docs._
DocsHelpers.renderScalaSnippet("akka-http", GeneratingClients)(
  """|// Two constructors are provided, one accepting the `httpClient`,
     |// `ExecutionContext`, and `Materializer` implicitly, the other accepting
     |// an explicit `httpClient`, but still accepting the `ExecutionContext` and
     |// `Materializer` as implicits.
  """.stripMargin,
  ""
)
```

### Separation of protocol-concerns from API-level concerns

As guardrail clients are built on top of the function type `HttpRequest => Future[HttpResponse]`, client configuration is reduced to function composition. Some ideas:

```scala
val singleRequestHttpClient = { (req: HttpRequest) =>
  Http().singleRequest(req)
}

val retryingHttpClient = { nextClient: (HttpRequest => Future[HttpResponse]) =>
    req: HttpRequest => nextClient(req).flatMap(resp => if (resp.status.intValue >= 500) nextClient(req) else Future.successful(resp))
}

val metricsHttpClient = { nextClient: (HttpRequest => Future[HttpResponse]) =>
    req: HttpRequest => {
        val resp = nextClient(req)
        resp.onSuccess { _resp =>
            trackMetrics(req.uri.path, _resp.status)
        }
        resp
    }
}

// Track metrics for every request, even retries
val retryingMetricsClient1: HttpRequest => Future[HttpResponse] = retryingHttpClient(metricsHttpClient(singleRequestHttpClient))

// Only track metrics for requests we didn't have to retry
val retryingMetricsClient2: HttpRequest => Future[HttpResponse] = metricsHttpClient(retryingHttpClient(singleRequestHttpClient))
```
